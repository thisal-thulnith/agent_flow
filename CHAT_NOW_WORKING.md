# ✅ CHAT IS NOW WORKING!

## What Was The Problem?

The LLM service expected messages to be **dictionaries** like:
```python
{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}
```

But it was receiving **strings** like:
```python
"Hello"
```

This caused the error:
```
Error generating response: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'
```

## ✅ How I Fixed It:

Updated `backend/agents/llm_service.py` to handle BOTH formats:
- If message is a **string** → treat it as user message
- If message is a **dict** → extract role and content

```python
for msg in messages:
    if isinstance(msg, str):
        langchain_messages.append(HumanMessage(content=msg))
    else:
        role = msg.get("role", "user")
        content = msg.get("content", "")
        # ... handle different roles
```
