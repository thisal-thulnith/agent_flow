# ✅ ALL CHAT ERRORS FIXED!

## What Was Wrong:

### Error 1: Qdrant Index Missing
```
Error searching vector store: Unexpected Response: 400 (Bad Request)
Index required but not found for "agent_id"
```

**Fixed**: Changed Qdrant search to filter results in code instead of using Qdrant's filter (which requires an index).

### Error 2: Response Type Error
```
Error generating response: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'
```

**Fixed**: Added type checking to handle when LangGraph returns a string instead of dict.
