# 🔧 FIREBASE AUTHENTICATION FIX

## ❌ Current Error:
```
Authentication failed: Your default credentials were not found
```

## ✅ Solution: Download Firebase Service Account

### Step 1: Download Service Account JSON

1. **Go to Firebase Console:**
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/sales-ai-agent-2ba4a/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk

2. **Generate New Private Key:**
   - Click "Service accounts" tab
   - Click "Generate new private key" button
   - Confirm by clicking "Generate key"
   - A JSON file will download

3. **Save the File:**
   ```bash
   # Move downloaded file to:
   /Users/thisalthulnith/sales_agent/backend/firebase-service-account.json
   ```

### Step 2: Restart Backend
```bash
# Backend will auto-reload when it detects the file
# Or manually restart
```
