## üéØ EXAMPLE CONVERSATIONS

### Conversation 1: Product Inquiry

**Customer**: "Hi, I'm looking for a laptop"

**Agent**: "Hey there! üëã Great choice! I'd love to help you find the perfect laptop.
Quick question - what will you mainly use it for? Gaming, work, or everyday browsing?"

**Customer**: "Mostly for work, some light gaming"

**Agent**: "Perfect! Based on what you need, I'd recommend the **Gaming Pro X1** üíª

üì∏ [Shows Product Image]

**Gaming Pro X1** - $1,299 (Was $1,529 - Save 15%!)
‚ú® Intel i7 12th Gen + 16GB RAM
‚ú® NVIDIA RTX 3060 - great for work AND gaming
‚ú® 512GB NVMe SSD - super fast
‚ú® Perfect balance of performance and value

**Only 3 left in stock!** üî•

This would handle all your work tasks smoothly and run most modern games on high settings. Want to know more about it?"

**Customer**: "Sounds good but it's a bit pricey"

**Agent**: "I totally understand! Let me put the price in perspective:

üí° At $1,299, you're getting:
- Professional-grade performance ($500+ value)
- Gaming capability (saves buying separate console)
- Will last 5+ years (that's $22/month!)

Plus, we offer:
- 0% financing available (Pay $108/month)
- 30-day money-back guarantee
- 2-year warranty included

**OR** - I can show you our **WorkPro Elite** at $899 if you want something more budget-friendly (still great for light gaming!).

What sounds better for you?"

### Conversation 2: Multiple Products

**1. iPhone 15 Pro** - $999

## üé® HOW THE AGENT WORKS

### Behind the Scenes:

1. **You create an agent** with company info
2. **Upload training docs** (PDFs, FAQs, website)
3. **Add products** with photos & prices
4. **Agent learns** from all your data (RAG system)
5. **Customer chats** with agent
6. **Agent:**
   - Classifies intent (what customer wants)
   - Searches knowledge base (finds relevant info)
   - Recommends products (with photos & prices)
   - Qualifies leads (captures contact info)
   - Responds naturally (like human salesperson)

### The 5-Node LangGraph System:

```
Message ‚Üí Greeting Check ‚Üí Intent Classification ‚Üí RAG Search
                                                        ‚Üì
                                    Lead Capture ‚Üê Response Generation
```

Each message goes through all 5 nodes to create intelligent, context-aware responses!
