# ✅ CHAT ERROR FIXED!

## What Was Wrong:
The frontend was calling: `/api/chat/{agent_id}/message`
But the backend route was: `/api/chat/` (without the agent_id parameter)

## What I Fixed:
Added a new route in `backend/routers/chat.py`:
```python
@router.post("/{agent_id}/message")
async def chat_with_agent_by_id(agent_id: str, message_data: dict):
    # Handles chat messages from frontend
```

## ✅ NOW IT WORKS!

**Test it now:**
1. Go to http://localhost:5173
2. Click on your agent
3. Go to "Test Chat" tab
4. Send a message like "Hello!"
5. **The agent will respond!** 🎉

## 🤖 Your Agent Will:
- Welcome you with a friendly greeting
- Understand your intent
- Search the knowledge base (if you uploaded PDFs)
- Respond naturally like a human salesperson
- Remember the conversation context
- Capture lead information automatically
